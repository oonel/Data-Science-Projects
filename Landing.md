## Welcome to my projects pages

Here I will be striving to host a range of projects I have worked on to share my methods and code.
The format is as follows:

- Most of the content will be presented in Jupyter Notebook format.
- This page will provide a brief overview of the project and a link to the relevant Jupyter Notebook
- Data will be download-able and the work reproducible



I use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/oonel/TestForWebsite/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for this website in Markdown files.
Here is link to my first page, [Page1](https://oonel.github.io/TestForWebsite/Page1)

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages runs [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages, from the content in my Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/oonel/TestForWebsite/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
